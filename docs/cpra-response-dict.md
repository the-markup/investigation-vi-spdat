# Public Records Response Data

This is a list of columns included in a data file provided by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) to The Markup in response to a California Public Records Act request and is the basis for our analysis. You can read more about it in the [Data Sourcing](TK) section of our methodology.

We chose not to publish this dataset, which includes answers to deeply personal questions, to [protect the privacy](https://themarkup.org/ethics) of the individuals included in the dataset. However, we include a cleaned version of this dataset called [`/data/assessments.csv`](/data/assessments.csv).
